# Style Changer
## Overview
Style Changer is an app that generates a new image with features of style image and content image.

## Description
I created the Style Changer as a demonstration of extract features for machine learning.
  

First, you can choose a style image from 5 type styles. Second, you can upload a content image. 
Finally, you can press the style conversion button. 
After a few minutes, new images with the features of those images are generated by the feature extraction.
  

I used the learned model VGG16 for feature extraction. 
The back end is implemented using Flask and Chainer, and the front end is implemented using React.js.
